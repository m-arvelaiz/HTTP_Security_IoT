# Security for HTTP and HTTPS Demo
To demonstrate the weakness of HTTP comunication some test were build to evaluate the protocol.

To evaluate the uses of HTTP in IoT system some "IoT situation wre recreated"

## Prerequisites

For demotration porpused the following tools where used:

- Noder-Red 
- Wireshark
- OpenSSL

The Test and demostrartion done for the HTTP, MITM attack and HTPPS can be done only installing the tools above.

-Docker (optional) - The files to launch the simulation were also tested using docker container to simulate the roles of the IoT Device, IoT Gatway or Cloud Server and the attacker. Using the containers the simulation it is recreating the different actor that can be involve during a http network in an IoT sistem.

## HTTP


### MITM Attack over HTTP
#### Eavesdroping


## HTTPS

### Downgrade attack


### HTCS

## Comments and Future updated of the Demo

- One of the most common situation in IoT environment in which Http is used is to connect with web server visual interface to configure and evaluate an IoT device.
